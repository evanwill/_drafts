I want to capture an annual snapshot of software I am using on my computer. 
This info is sort of embedded in other notes where I talk about setting up Ubuntu, but I thought it would be interesting to regularly record a snapshot to compare over time.
I have noticed a significant decrease in software I actually use, moving more to either browser or text editor.

## Jan 2021

- Distro: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS - I used to really enjoy installing the latest releases and completely wiping my laptop every 6 months, but lately LTS seems less work...
- Desktop: 
    - GNOME 3.36.8
    - Extensions: [Caffeine](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/)
    - GNOME Tweaks
- Browsers:
    - Firefox 85 - I use firefox for every thing. Interesting to have work access to office365, Word is just as terrible in browser as on desktop.
        - uBlock Origin
        - Multi-Account Containers
        - Facebook Container
    - Chromium 88 (snap) - I use chromium just for testing web development. I prefer the dev tools to Firefox's.
- Text editors:
    - VS Code - used constantly, but getting more annoyed by each update. It seems like it is getting constantly more features, with debugging and information popping up everywhere. I don't need or appreciate that stuff. I spend a lot of time trying to turn it off, but seems harder... 
    - TextEditor / Gedit - used as extra scratch pad constantly.
    - Atom - installed, but not used. I want to like it (it seems like it *should* be slightly better than VS Code), but just seems slow and not quite right. Not having a good integrated terminal is a big draw back for me.
- Other GUI software:
    - GIMP
    - OBS Studio
    - VidCutter
    - KeePassXC
    - Etcher
    - OpenRefine
    - LibreOffice Calc
- Pandemic work from home has introduced some new every day tools:
    - Zoom - not great on Linux, has less features, freezes up on screen share.
    - Cisco VPN
    - Remmina
- Command line tools:
    - git
    - ImageMagick
    - ExifTool (via `libimage-exiftool-perl`)
    - ffmpeg 
    - Pandoc 
    - LaTeX (via `texlive texlive texlive-fonts-extra texlive-xetex texlive-extra-utils`) - mainly just for use with Pandoc.
    - Ruby (via rbenv) - used to do more with Python, but recently just using commandline, OpenRefine, or Ruby + Rake for anything.
    - Jekyll (via Ruby)
    - Java (via `default-jre`) - just for use with OpenRefine.
    - tlp tlp-rdw - laptop battery utilities.

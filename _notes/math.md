Encountering the every increasing absolute crap AI web content ecosystem and thinking about LLM lack of ability to do math randomly inspired me to make this useful and absolutely essential project:

[Correct Math Answers](https://evanwill.github.io/correct-math-answers/)

I hope to add static generated pages to better allow AI bots to crawl and capture all the information to help train their models, but I enjoyed getting this rapidly set up, starting from [bootstrap5-template](https://github.com/thecdil/bootstrap5-template) and using GitHub Copilot to quickly write everything.

Like my other random projects, this was essentially a learning opportunity to figure out how to better use Copilot efficiently. 
I think having the LLM inside a well-known, self-contained environment is helpful to get better results than starting from scratch or letting it add batches of random dependencies.

From the site:

"Do you need to know 2 + 2, 6 - 4, 10 * -5, or 99 / 678493? We’ve got you covered! And you don’t need a calculator.
If you need correct answers to math questions this site will provide exactly what you need."

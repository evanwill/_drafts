The following notes provide a TON of information about getting started with Linux. 
But first, *take a deep breath*... don't get overwhelmed by all this information! 

The barrier to getting started with desktop Linux on your own computer is much lower than you expect. 
Choose a Linux distribution (I suggest Ubuntu to start), create a live USB, plug it in to your computer, and voilà--you can try out Linux without having to install anything!

Learn all the details from these notes:

1. [Intro to Linux](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/linux-intro.html), learn about how to choose a Distro.
2. [Burn USB](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/burn-iso.html), learn how to create a Live USB install media.
3. [Boot USB](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/linux-boot-usb.html), the tips and tricks to boot a Live USB.
4. Demo time (explore the "live session" from the USB. connect to the wifi, try the apps, just don't click install!)
5. [Command Line demo](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/commandline.html) (optional)

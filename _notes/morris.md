I've always enjoyed the writing of [William Morris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Morris), a true "renaissance man" who dabbled well in an amazing array of artistic, academic, and social pursuits. 
Building on my [Aladore projects](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/aladore.html), I was interested in creating some projects with Morris texts to further explore creating useable web editions with added data features using static web generation.

In 2020 I created [morris-wondrous-isles-book project](https://evanwill.github.io/morris-wondrous-isles-book/) building an edition of *The Water of the Wondrous Isles* (1897).
The intent was to create a fully self-contained, minimal static web-based "artisanal" digital edition.
With the text parsed into semi-structured markdown files, there is new opportunities to generate data and search.

Water of the Wondrous Isles is a fascinating book, a female protagonist, powerful women, strange magic, in a fairy tale like setting.
Give it a read at [morris-wondrous-isles-book](https://evanwill.github.io/morris-wondrous-isles-book/)!

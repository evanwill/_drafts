retroarch: https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/wiki/Compilation-guide-(Linux)

RetroArch doesn't require GL. You can compile it without GL/GLES/EGL at the expense of some features (no fancy menus, only RGUI; no shaders). I'm assuming you'll be able to compile it similarly to how it used to be compiled for rpi (note that opengl/egl/gles are disabled during the ./configure step):

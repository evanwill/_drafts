[Pasty Awareness Week](https://evanwill.github.io/pastyAware/) was one of my first personal static web projects on GitHub.
I started from an old version of the default Jekyll `minima` theme and added some content that is near & dear to my heart. 

Creating this pretty random project was a great way to learn more about Jekyll and GitHub Pages when I was first starting out. 
The platforms and my development has evolved a lot since then, but the content is definitely still really good and important. 

If you don't know, pasties are a delicious food commonly found in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the Iron Range of Minnesota (and a few other US mining areas like Butte, Montana).
In the UK they think Cornish folks invented them or something, but the things in the UP are uniquely their own and much better.

Be sure to celebrate National Pasty Awareness Week every year and share [#PastyAware](https://evanwill.github.io/pastyAware/)!

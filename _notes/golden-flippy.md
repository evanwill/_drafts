Rules for the *classic* beer game:

- each player must create their own golden flippy things (i.e. by taking bottle caps and pounding them flat and smooth with a hammer)
- each player should have a bunch
- each player should probably have an equal amount
- each round all players: 
    - put one flippy into the pot
    - shake out all of their golden flippy things at once
    - then count up your flippies that landed with gold side up:
        - person with most gold up wins,
        - unless a player has *all* non-gold side up, then they win,
        - unless there is a tie, then all players have to put one extra flippy into the pot and no one wins this round.
    - the winner collects all flippies in the pot

Mechanics make it so that once someone starts winning, they will likely keep winning, yet it is quite hard to finish players off.

> these official rules date back to Pittsburgh, 2000.

In 2021, I created the [Beowulf-s project](https://evanwill.github.io/beowulf-s/) essentially by using OpenRefine to parse the text of Chauncey B. Tinker's *The Translations of Beowulf: A Critical Bibliography* (1903) into structured data.
Tinker *as data* provides a handy curated list of (now) public domain texts, so I enriched the data with links to digitized copies of each record on the web.
I could then use the structured data (a CSV) to generate a website ([using CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/)) to explore the historic bibliography of Beowulf translations. 

The whole project was inspired by Maria Dahvana Headleyâ€™s introduction to *Beowulf: a New Translation* (2020), which I would recommend giving a read!
I describe it all a bit more on the [About page](https://evanwill.github.io/beowulf-s/about.html).

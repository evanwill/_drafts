Inspired by memories of Chocolate Moose in Ely, MN, and ancient ancestral foods, we wanted to create thick, custardy Pannukakku (a Finnish oven pancake). 
Partly based on a ["Scandinavian food expert" website](https://web.archive.org/web/20150523014123/http://scandinavianfood.about.com:80/od/pancakewafflerecipes/r/pannukakku.htm), we came up with this recipe.

Basic concept is to create a batter following the ratio of `1 egg : 1/4 cup flour : 1/4 cup milk`, beating it very well.
Add a bit of vanilla, sugar, baking powder, and lemon zest, then bake in a hot oven. 

We are not very exact about the measurements, but here is an approximate recipe for a rectangle cake pan.
We like to use enough eggs to create a fairly thick pancake, which will be more custardy in the middle.

In a big bowl, add:

- 8 eggs
- 2 cup flour
- 2 cup milk
- 2 Tbs sugar
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 tsp cardamom 
- dash of salt

Beat it up really well (I think you want to get some air into the batter), then let it sit for awhile.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees (or higher).
After the batter has rested a bit, add:

- 1 tsp baking powder
- a bit of lemon zest (or lemon juice)

And mix up well.

Take a pan (oven safe cast iron or glass cake pan), add a couple big dollops of butter, and put into the oven until the butter is melted and bubbling near browning.
Pull out the pan, pour the batter in, and pop it back into the oven.

Bake for around 15 minutes, until golden on top (it will puff up a lot!). 

Meanwhile, whip up some fresh whipped cream. 

Serve chucks of the pannukakku topped with whipped cream and fresh or canned berries.
(Alternatively, serve with syrup or with lemon and butter)

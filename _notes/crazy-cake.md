> My favorite cake ("minimal cake infrastructure"), regularly cooked after school when a teenager. 
> Very delicious and very simple to make.
> Since this recipe always comes out well it is also great for experimenting by adding random other ingredients. 

Heat oven 350 degrees.

Combine all dry ingredients directly in an ungreased 9 x 13in pan:

- 3 cups flour
- 2 cups sugar
- 1/2 cup baking cocoa (you can play with this amount depending on how strong you like your chocolate, approximately from 1/3 cp to 2/3 cup, or even 0)
- 2 teaspoons baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt

After mixing the dry stuff in the pan, make three depressions and add each liquid ingredient into is own spot:

- 2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 3/4 cup vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons vinegar

Next pour:

- 2 cups cold water

over everything in the pan.
Mixing everything up with a fork (blend it up, but don't beat or over mix). 

Put pan in the oven and bake for approximately 34 - 40 minutes until pick comes out clean.

I generally like to serve it up right away just plain with some milk.
But you can treat it just like any other cake (e.g. cool and frost it, etc).

## Install on Windows 7 

Jekyll does not officially support Windows, however it is cross platform (they just don't officially write windows documentation or check for bugs). 
There is a [Jekyll on Windows](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/#installation) page, but it is out of date. Not everything mentioned is required any more.

> For more complete install info, and other platforms see [go-go gh-pages](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages/0-prep.html).

Here are the steps I took to get it running on Windows 7 or 10:

1. Get Ruby installed:
  - Download [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/), a installer package for windows.
  - Run RubyInstaller, all the defaults should be fine.
  - Download the Ruby Development Kit from the [RubyInstaller](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) page. If you installed Ruby 32 bit, get `DevKit-mingw64-32-4.7.2-20130224-1151-sfx.exe`. Documentation is on [GitHub](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit)
  - Click on the Dev Kit to unzip (its a self extracting package), put it in a permanent location, such as `C:\rubyDevKit\`
  - Open a command prompt in the Dev Kit directory, then type the command `ruby dk.rb init`, then `ruby dk.rb install` to connect to your Ruby instance.

2. Install Jekyll:
  - Open a command prompt, then type `gem install jekyll bundler` (gem is Ruby's installer, similar to Python's pip)
  - Done!

3. Use Jekyll:
  - To create a new demo project, open a command prompt, type `jekyll new testsite` 
  - Jekyll will create a new directory with the given name that includes all the files necessary for a basic project
  - Move to the new directory, type `cd testsite`
  - To start working with it, type `jekyll serve`. (note: for larger sites you will want to activate incremental build, use the short command `jekyll s -i`)
  - Open web browser and visit http://localhost:4000 
  - To stop the server, type `Ctrl+C` in the command prompt.
  - While `jekyll serve` is active, Jekyll watches the project directory and builds a static html site in the directory `_site` which it serves locally. 
  - Jekyll watches for any changes you made to the project files and rebuilds the `_site` as necessary.
  - Don't make changes to the `_site` directory. It is generated by Jekyll from all the other files. 
  - Jekyll bundles together a bunch of other helpful development tools, such as [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) for CSS and [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) for templating pages. 
  - When you are done developing, the contents of the `_site` directory will be copied to your host location (for example testweb or github).
  - Use a good text editor, since files should be UTF-8, and there can be issues with line endings. I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is handy for navigating the directory structure.

## A tour of the project directory

- `testsite` (the top level contains pages that will become top level pages. Edit the overall site settings in `_config.yml`. Changes to `_config.yml` are not automatically refreshed during `jekyll serve`, you have to stop the server and restart.)
  - `_includes` These are modular chunks of your pages which can be called into a page layout by Liquid. For example `{% raw %}{% include head.html %}{% end raw %}` in a page layout would add the include `head.html` from the `_includes` directory.
  - `_layouts` These are basic templates for complete web pages. They are constructed out of includes. The layouts are called by files that have content to add the template structure.
  - `_posts` This directory contains blog posts. We are more likely to use a `_collections` directory for similar automated treatment of standardized content pages.
  - `_sass` This contains the modular `.scss` files that will be pulled into your main css for the site. All normal CSS is valid SCSS, but Sass adds many helpful functions and programatic features which are compiled into regular CSS automatically. 
  - `_site` This is the built out version of your new static site. 
  - `css` Contains the base SCSS file that will be compiled into a single CSS file for the site. You can set all your Sass varibles in one place (if you are using them) and call in your scss partials from `_sass` by using `@import "base";`
  - You can add other directories as needed for site assets such as `images`. They will be copied directly to the `_site` directory.

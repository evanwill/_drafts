My favorite Yuletime treat is marshmallow wreaths--crisp cereal embedded in sumptuous green marshmallow goo, lovingly formed into circles and adorned with red candies.
Somehow, they are richer (and of course much more festive) than regular rice crispy treats. 

## Ingredients

- 1/2 c. (115g) butter
- 4 c. (200g) marshmallows
- 1/2 tsp (3ml) vanilla
- 4 c. (190g) cereal (corn flakes, rice crispy, or whatever)
- 1 tsp (5ml) green food coloring
- Cinnamon Imperials / red hots (little red candies for decoration)

## Preparation

1. Add butter and marshmallows to a large glass bowl. 
2. Microwave in 30 second increments until fully melted, stirring occasionally. 
3. Add vanilla and food coloring, and mix well (should be *extremely* green for maximum festiveness). 
4. Add cereal and mix furiously (as your mixture is probably getting very sticky). 
5. Painstakingly form into circular wreath shapes on wax paper or greased pan. 
6. While still sticky, decorate each with three red hots to make pretty.

## Notes

I first tried to reproduce these on my own while living in Scotland. 
I translated the american style measurements (cups, tea spoons, etc) into UK style metric, and found some delicious artisan marshmallows made with natural pork gelatin. 
I soon discovered it was rather hard and far too tedious to reproduce the wreath shapes. 
However, my research confirms that they are equally delicious no matter what they look like...
(for example, in 2009 my efforts resulted in a large red blob, which I served to Scottish people claiming it was a famous american delicacy and received positive reviews.)

I have converted the ingredients back to american style measurements--metric is provided in parenthesis in case you bring this heirloom recipe with you in your world travels.

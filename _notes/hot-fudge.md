Heat oven to 350 degrees.
Grease a square baking pan (or small oval casserole, or double recipe for big rectangle baking pan). 

In a mixing bowl, add:

- 1 cup flour
- 2/3 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup baking cocoa
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 ts vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup vegetable oil 
- 1/2 cup milk

Mix it all up into thick batter. 
Spread into the greased square pan.
Use a spatula to scrape out the mixing bowl pretty clean and dry.

In the fairly clean mixing bowl, add:

- 1/4 cup baking cocoa
- 3/4 cup brown sugar

Mix it up.
Sprinkle over the top of the batter in the pan (don't mix in at all).

Prep (in electric kettle or microwave or whatever):

- 1 1/4 cup hot water

Pour the hot water over the pan (don't stir or mix or anything). 

Put into oven and bake about 40 - 45 minutes.
The top will become a brownie like crust, with gooey hot fudge sauce below.

Remove from oven, let cool a few minutes, then serve immediately in bowls. 

I like to serve with some milk or ice cream.

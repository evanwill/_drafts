Finding strings you like on your ukulele is surprisingly complicated. 
It is a very personal choice, depending on your ukulele, the sound and feel you like, and your playing style.
And it's hard to find advice (its all conflicting forum-post rant style garbage).

I enjoyed reading this ongoing strings journal ["Best Strings for Baritone Uke: A Three-Year Experiment"](https://baritoneukes.com/choosing-strings-for-baritone-ukuleles/).
So thought I would do something similar for myself.
As most of this blog, this is mainly notes to my future self!

> p.s. I find this [west music how to replace strings](https://content.westmusic.com/blog-how-to-replace-ukulele-strings/) helpful for knot diagrams.

## Baritone Ukulele Context

I'm a intermediate beginner, not particularly good. 
I pick and strum, but really just like to strum out campfire jams.
I play DGBE, low D.
I have two cheaper end baritones:

- Kala Satin Mahogany Baritone [KA-B](https://kalabrand.com/products/ka-b) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20220519070825/https://kalabrand.com/products/ka-b))
- Ohana Solid Spruce & Round Composite Back Baritone [BK-70RB](https://ohana-music.com/products/ohana-ukuleles-ck-70rb-solid-spruce-round-composite-back-concert?variant=31535720136804) ([archived](https://web.archive.org/web/20220411072715/https://ohana-music.com/products/ohana-ukuleles-ck-70rb-solid-spruce-round-composite-back-concert?variant=31535720136804))

I have purchased most strings from [Strings by Mail](https://www.stringsbymail.com/ukulele-strings-684/baritone-ukulele-strings-3214/), except [Uke Logic on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/UkeLogic).

## Strings I Have Tried

When I get ready to change strings, I record a video sound check of myself with a few chords and picking greensleeves on the old strings. 
Once the new strings are fully settled in, I record the same thing. 
This gives me a chance to listen to the differences.
All the strings have been *very* different, and also distinct on each ukulele.
It is hard to characterize without an extensive music vocabulary, but these are my impressions.

Organized from favorite to least favorite.

### Uke Logic Baritone "Hard Tension"

On BK-70RB:

Seemed to settle in quickly. 
Good volume, lots of sustain.
Full, rich tone, mellower than other bright flourocarbon, but still has that crispness.

I choose the "pink" version, which is just cosmetic, a very light pink tint to the clear flourocarbon strings--but looks nice, interesting at least.

The gold wound string is smooth, seems very stiff and heavy when installing, but feels good and balanced with other strings when playing. 
It seems to have a real strong, driving sound giving body to chords without overpowering.

The tension *is* noticeably "hard" compared to other strings. 

I really like the sound and feel of these strings. 
They seem unique.

| String | Material | Diameter (in) |
| E | Pink Fluorocarbon | 0.023" |
| B | Pink Fluorocarbon | 0.028" |
| G | Pink Fluorocarbon | 0.036" |
| D | Gold smooth wound | 0.030" |

There is an option for D Flourocarbon at 0.042".
This seemed too big for my nut, so I didn't try it.

### PhD Strings - Premium High Density 

On KA-B:

After using the stretchy Worth Browns, these felt a much nicer balanced tension.
They seem to have a full bright tone, with strong sustain and volume.
They feel good on fingers, smooth.

PhD doesn't publish diameters anywhere I could find. 
Material is "PVDF", some sort of fluorocarbon.

### Worth Brown

On KA-B:

Nice rich, mild sound.
Seemed to make the KA-B's tone crisper and louder than Aquilas.

They have an oddly low tension, or sort of stretchiness, that I didn't really like.
They took forever to settle in and stay in tune.

| String | Material | Diameter (in) |
| E | Brown Fluorocarbon | .0244 |
| B | Brown Fluorocarbon | .0291 |
| G | Brown Fluorocarbon | .0319 |
| D | Brown Fluorocarbon | .0358 |

Lots of people repeat that Worth brown and clear are the same--that doesn't seem true, Worth intends them to have different sound qualities, not just looks.

### Aquila Nylgut 

Came as stock on both my Baritones (which is very common). 

On KA-B: 

They sounded okay, nothing particularly noteworthy--flourocarbon strings sound much crisper in comparison. 
However, I wore out the wound strings very rapidly, leaving cuts at each fret, so I had to change them out soon. 
Much prefer the durability of fluorocarbon.

On BK-70RB: 

They sounded very crisp, *very* loud, powerful, a bit jangley like a guitar--I liked the sound a lot.
There seemed to be wider dynamics possible compared to other strings.
The nylgut strings feel uniquely crispy and responsive.
They occasionally had a buzz on the wound strings--not enough tension on low action. 
However, I hated the feel on the BK-70RB--the wound strings feel very different from the nylgut, and the tensions are so inconsistent.
It bothered me enough to change them before wearing them out.

| String | Material | Diameter (mm) |
| E | nylgut | 0.67 |
| B | nylgut | 0.84 |
| G | wound | 0.60 |
| D | wound | 0.70 |

I am intrigued by other unique Aquila strings (Sugar and Red), but since they all come with the same two wound lower strings there doesn't seem like much point to trying them out--not enough durability.

### Oasis Fluorocarbon Uke Baritone UKE-8200B

Strings come as double length size, so each pack is really two sets, meaning these are actually the cheapest strings I have tried.

On BK-70RB:

First impression was the tone sounds nice, clear, and distinct. 
However, I noticed a serious loss of volume and sustain.
The surface has an odd grippiness, which feels fine--but when I play creates terrible squichy sounds from my fingers--it drove me crazy.
I also had a buzz on the G string, I guess due to lower tension on low action. 

After playing these for two weeks I hated them. 
They felt sort of dead.
Bad.

| String | Material | Diameter (in) |
| E | Fluorocarbon | .0244” |
| B | Fluorocarbon | .0291” |
| G | Fluorocarbon | .0315” |
| D | Fluorocarbon | .0358” |

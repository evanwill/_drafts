Search the repository at [Ubuntu Packages](http://packages.ubuntu.com/) to find proper names to install with `sudo apt install`.
If you want to install apps from outside the repositories, download the `.deb`. 
Install `.deb` via commandline using `sudo dpkg -i package-name.deb`, and remove with `sudo dpkg -r package-name` (note: the remove package name is not the same as the `.deb`'s name).

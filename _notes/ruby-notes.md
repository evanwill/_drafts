[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) is an interesting language, but can be a bit frustrating with the many versions and incompatibilities.
My main use is for working with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) or [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/).

On Windows I always use [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/), which seems to work well. 

On Linux, I have tried the version in the distro repositories (Ubuntu: `ruby-full`), but this is usually fairly out-of-date and can cause some headaches (such as requiring `sudo` to install gems, unless you edit your bash profile, see Jekyll [Ubuntu install docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}).
On Ubuntu 19.10 `ruby-full` will be version 2.5.1, and updates are rare.

A better, easy alternative is to use the official [Ruby snap package](https://snapcraft.io/ruby) maintained by the Ruby core team which stays up-to-date.
Install using `sudo snap install ruby â€“classic` (*note:* the `-classic` flag means the snap will not be "confined", since Ruby will need full access to your system to function. Snaps requiring `-classic` are audited by the repository).
The snap will keep itself up-to-date, so may change versions on you.
You may need to install additional build tools as well (at least ` build-essential zlib1g-dev`).

However, you might want to use a Ruby version manager to keep your dependencies in order and separate from your system Ruby.
I have used [RVM](https://rvm.io/) described below--however, more recently switched to using rbenv (see [rbenv notes](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/ruby-rbenv.html)).

When installing RVM on Ubuntu there can be some barriers because the way RVM functions isn't compatible with the default set up of Gnome terminal--either you can reconfigure, or do a little workaround by setting up a second terminal. 

## Set up RVM on Ubuntu

Install curl and build-essential if you don't have them (`sudo apt install curl build-essential`).

Set up Tilix: 

- Install Tilix terminal emulator (`sudo apt install tilix`)
- Open Tilix
- Click on the user name above the terminal window, select Profiles > Edit Profile.
- Click on Command tab, check "Run command as a login shell"
- Close Tilix

Open Tilix and install RVM using the [official instructions](https://rvm.io/rvm/install)  (note: there is a [PPA for Ubuntu](https://github.com/rvm/ubuntu_rvm) that can take care of everything).

Install a Ruby version, probably the most recent stable (listed on [Ruby downloads](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)), for example: 
`rvm install 2.7.0`. 
This will download all the dependencies and build the Ruby version, which might take awhile... 

When it completes, check your Ruby, `ruby -v`.
If this is your first version, it will become the default, or you can select one, `rvm use 2.7.0`.
If you want to generate the documentation, run `rvm docs generate-ri`.

Now you can install Jekyll: `gem install bundler jekyll`

Once you restart your system, Gnome terminal will recognize your current Ruby version. 
Use RVM from Tilix.

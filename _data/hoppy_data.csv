Calm One HopTea,Hoplark,2,2,0,0,4,"This is probably the most delicious HopTea, the sweet smoothness of chamomile suits the flavors very well. Citra hops."
Really Hoppy One HopTea,Hoplark,3,4,0,0,2,"The flavors of this aren't very balanced, I find it overly hoppy but not delicious."
Green Tea One HopTea,Hoplark,2,4,0,0,3,"Pretty good balance of very light beverage and good hop aroma. Mosaic hops."
Mile-High-Biscus One HopTea,Hoplark,2,4,0,0,3,"Surprisingly delicious, I didn't expect to like the hibiscus, but it adds nicely to the aroma."
Hop Splash,Sierra Nevada,1,1,0,0,2,"Tastes like a normal sparkling water, the hops are there, but its pretty light and the favor isn't totally balanced. Refreshing. Citra and Amarillo hops."
Juicy IPA,Grüvi,3,4,3,3,3,"Marketed as non-alcoholic craft brew, this goes for beeriness and does a good job. Interestingly, the taste and aroma in the first few minutes is GREAT, but then it seems to gradually get sweeter and less delicious as it warms."
Stout,Grüvi,1,1,4,4,4,"Really tasty rich stout."
Non-Alcoholic IPA,Fremont,3,2,3,3,2,"Pretty solid as a basic IPA substitute."
Run Wild IPA,Athletic Brewing Co.,3,4,3,3,4,"This is pretty delicious as an light IPA."
